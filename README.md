### 🚀 About Me
I am a **Software Engineer** focused on building scalable cloud-native systems and high-performance web architectures. Currently, I am a Master's student at **Northeastern University** and a **Software Engineer Co-op at Origin AI**, where I engineer asynchronous backend systems for reliability and scale.

Previously, I built enterprise SaaS products at **Zoho Corporation**, impacting over 1,000+ enterprise clients. My engineering philosophy prioritizes **system design, automation, and observability**.

### ⚡ Current Engineering Focus: [Code2Cloud](https://github.com/Lakshman-99/Code2Cloud)
*Building a Vercel-like PaaS from scratch.*

**Code2Cloud** is a production-grade Platform as a Service (PaaS) that replicates Vercel's core deployment engine. It enables developers to link GitHub accounts and automatically deploy full-stack applications (Node.js/Python) via an automated build pipeline.

**Core Challenges Solved:**
* **Automated Orchestration:** Dynamic containerization of user repositories based on language detection.
* **Build Pipeline:** Custom CI/CD logic to handle dependency installation, build generation, and artifact storage.
* **Cloud Primitives:** Leveraging AWS to provision isolated execution environments on demand.
